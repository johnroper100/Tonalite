# Welcome to the Tonalite v2.0.0 Beta 6 Documentation!

This book will show you how to get started using Tonalite to create professional lighting quickly and easily.

### Who Is Tonalite For?

Tonalite is for smaller theater venues that need an easy to use lighting control system that is still powerful enough to control modern lights. It is designed to work with industry-standard hardware, and is meant to be as intuitive as possible.

### What Is Tonalite Meant to Do?

Tonalite is meant to control lighting rigs using a web interface, accessible from any device on the network, such as a phone, tablet, or laptop. This allows the operator to control the lighting while moving throughout the theater. You can also use it with a wired connection to prevent against connection issues in a production environment.

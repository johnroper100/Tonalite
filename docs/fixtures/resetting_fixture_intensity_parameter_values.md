# Resetting Fixture Intensity Parameter Values

You can reset the values of every fixture's intensity parameters using one button. To do so, click the red `Reset Intensity` button on the top of the `Fixtures` tab. You will be asked to make sure you want to do this because this will cause a blackout in most cases.

This fuction is useful when you have moving fixtures or fixtures with multiple parameters and you only want to make them turn off without resetting their position, color, etc.

# Using Group Effects

Tonalite supports several group effects. Each of these group effects falls into a specific category based on what parameter(s) of a group's fixtures they control. These categories are:

- Intensity
- Position
- Color
- Parameter

## Effect Display

When a group has effects added to it, they are displayed at the bottom of the group's parameters page.

# Adding Sequences

Add a sequence using the green `Add Sequence` button on the top of the `Cues` > `Sequences` sub-tab. This will open a modal that shows the available fixtures in the show and allows you to select which ones you would like to control with this sequence.

To select a fixture, click on it in the list, and the new group will control this fixture along with any others you select. You can select multiple on this list.
